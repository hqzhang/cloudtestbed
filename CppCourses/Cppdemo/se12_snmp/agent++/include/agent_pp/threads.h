/**
 * The Runnable interface should be implemented by any class whose 
 * instances are intended to be executed by a thread. The class must 
 * define a method of no arguments called run. 
 *
 * This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects 
 * that wish to execute code while they are active. For example, 
 * Runnable is implemented by class Thread. Being active simply means 
 * that a thread has been started and has not yet been stopped. 
 *
 * In addition, Runnable provides the means for a class to be active 
 * while not subclassing Thread. A class that implements Runnable can 
 * run without subclassing Thread by instantiating a Thread instance and
 * passing itself in as the target. In most cases, the Runnable interface 
 * should be used if you are only planning to override the run() method 
 * and no other Thread methods. This is important because classes should
 * not be subclassed unless the programmer intends on modifying or 
 * enhancing the fundamental behavior of the class.
