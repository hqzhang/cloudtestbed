"This object determines the type of notification to
 be generated for entries in the snmpTargetAddrTable
 selected by the corresponding instance of
 snmpNotifyTag. This value is only used when
 generating notifications, and is ignored when
 using the snmpTargetAddrTable for other purposes.

 If the value of this object is trap(1), then any
 messages generated for selected rows will contain
 Unconfirmed-Class PDUs.

 If the value of this object is inform(2), then any
 messages generated for selected rows will contain
 Confirmed-Class PDUs.

 Note that if an SNMP entity only supports
 generation of Unconfirmed-Class PDUs (and not
 Confirmed-Class PDUs), then this object may be
 read-only."

 To create a row in this table, a manager must
 set this object to either createAndGo(4) or

 Until instances of all corresponding columns are
 appropriately configured, the value of the
 corresponding instance of the
 snmpNotifyFilterProfileRowStatus column is 'notReady'.

 In particular, a newly created row cannot be made
 active until the corresponding instance of
 snmpNotifyFilterProfileName has been set."

/**
 *  snmpNotifyFilterMask
 *
"The bit mask which, in combination with the corresponding
 instance of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree, defines a family of
 subtrees which are included in or excluded from the
 filter profile.

 Each bit of this bit mask corresponds to a
 sub-identifier of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree, with the
 most significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet
 string value (extended if necessary, see below)
 corresponding to the (8*i - 7)-th sub-identifier, and
 the least significant bit of the i-th octet of this
 octet string corresponding to the (8*i)-th
 sub-identifier, where i is in the range 1 through 16.

 Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not
 the corresponding sub-identifiers must match when
 determining if an OBJECT IDENTIFIER matches this
 family of filter subtrees; a '1' indicates that an
 exact match must occur; a '0' indicates 'wild card',
 i.e., any sub-identifier value matches.

 Thus, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER X of an object instance
 is contained in a family of filter subtrees if, for
 each sub-identifier of the value of
 snmpNotifyFilterSubtree, either:

 the i-th bit of snmpNotifyFilterMask is 0, or

 the i-th sub-identifier of X is equal to the i-th
 sub-identifier of the value of
 snmpNotifyFilterSubtree.

 If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and
 there are more than M sub-identifiers in the
 corresponding instance of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree,
 then the bit mask is extended with 1's to be the
 required length.

 Note that when the value of this object is the
 zero-length string, this extension rule results in
 a mask of all-1's being used (i.e., no 'wild card'),
 and the family of filter subtrees is the one
 subtree uniquely identified by the corresponding
 instance of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree."
